**Abstract**

Personalized treatment planning, enhanced by Natural Language Processing (NLP), represents a significant advancement in precision medicine. NLP techniques are employed to analyze unstructured clinical data, including electronic health records (EHRs), medical literature, and patient narratives, enabling the extraction of critical information for individualized care. These techniques help in identifying unique patient conditions and predicting treatment responses by processing large datasets to uncover patterns and correlations. Integrating NLP with clinical decision support systems allows healthcare providers to design tailored treatment strategies, improving patient outcomes and optimizing resource utilization. This research explores the various NLP methodologies applied in personalized medicine and their impact on healthcare delivery.
